## About
Building Snap adds grid snapping capabilities to Placeable structures in FS22.  In Construction mode, you can toggle the position snap grid size (default key G) and rotation snap angle (default key R) to fit your liking.  The grid snap can also be turned off by setting the position to 0m and/or the angle to 0°.  You can set each one individually.

#### Possible Position Snap Sizes:
- 0m (Off/Game Default)
- 0.5m (Mod Default)
